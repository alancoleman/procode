> 1. Present a basic numbered menu asking a user to make a selection from GET Single Post, GET Single Comment, GET 10 Posts, GET 10 Comments
> 2. Upon selection the script will trigger the corresponding GET request to the fake Api JSONPlaceholder - Free Fake REST API (typicode.com)
> 3. The script should then output the results to the PowerShell window.
> 4. As a bonus, deserialise the JSON object into a better format.
